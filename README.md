Accounts
========

The `accounts` table holds a list of the user's accounts. There are five main types of accounts,
asset, liability, income, expense, and equity. You can read more about the account types and how
they are handled on the [Debits and Credits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debits_and_credits#Elements) Wikipedia article.

The accounts are affected in a positive or negative way, depending on their type.
